# pi-ansible
Ansible playbooks for configuring my media server.

### TODO:
- Assign static IP

- Run smbpassswd for the created user account using the same password
- configure the plex server

### Overview

This playbook is intended to be used to setup up my Raspberry Pi which I primarily use as a media server. The Vagrantfile is intended to be used in testing the playbook. We run the playbook on a virtual machine, then verify it's working correctly before deploying to the Raspberry Pi.

```
> apt-get install ansible
